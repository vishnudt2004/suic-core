# Simple UI Components

**Simple UI Components** is a **personal, local-first collection of reusable UI and frontend utility components** — installed locally as editable source code with minimal setup. Each component is **handcrafted from scratch**, reflecting my own ideas and needs while staying flexible enough to adapt to yours.

This is **not** a large, general-purpose UI library. Instead, it’s a **curated set of distinctive, editable components** designed for **direct integration into your projects** — perfect for portfolio work, prototypes, or internal tools.

> **Note:**  
> Every component is built independently — no direct copies from other libraries.

## Simple UI Components – Core Components

The **suic-core** (Simple UI Components Core) repository is the home of all reusable UI components for the SUIC ecosystem. Each component is **handcrafted and customizable**, designed for direct use in your projects or via the **suic-cli** (Simple UI Components CLI).
